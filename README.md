# emojiis

Emojiis is a Go module that exposes a programmatic API to search and retrieve emoji icons using descriptive terms.

## Version 2.0.0 released

Version 2.0 uses a JSON file (from https://github.com/milesj/emojibase) 
for its dataset, containing all commonly used emojis.

The API has been updated (if you use v1.xx, some functions may break after you update).

Features:
* Ability to search the full set of common emojis
* Support for inclusion and exclusion search terms
* Ability to search by emoji tags
